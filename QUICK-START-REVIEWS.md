  // Add more products...
};
```

### Change review display:
Modify the `displayReviews()` function in `reviewpage.html` to customize:
- Colors
- Layout
- Additional fields

### Add more features:
Use the `ReviewsManager` class from `reviews.js`:
```javascript
// Get average rating
const rating = await reviewsManager.getProductRating("Product Name");

// Get user's reviews
const myReviews = await reviewsManager.getUserReviews(userId);

// Update a review
await reviewsManager.updateReview(reviewId, 4, "Updated text");
```
